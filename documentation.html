              This page uses a simple design to be used by anyone regardless of age, field in which they operate. 
              In the background we have a photo from the courier field, easy to follow and pleasing to the human eye

            <p>
              Behind this page is a wireframe from which it started to reach the final page, it was indicative helping to create this page
            </p>
            <img src="images\LoginRegister.png" alt="image" class="center" />
            <p>This page started from a hand-drawn sketch on a tablet, and from this sketch it ended up in it:</p>

            <h2>Home Page</h2>
            <p>
              The application gives users the opportunity to find out information about the package they are waiting for. They can do this by inserting the unique AWB number, thus receiving all the necessary information. Users can also report a problem with the product they received and make a return back.
            </p>
            <img src="images/Homepage.png" alt="image" class="center" />
            <p>
              The page has a simplistic design, with a transparent box that includes all the things that interact with the user. The text is easy to read with precise and uncomplicated things
            </p>

            <h2>Services Page</h2>
            <p>
              This page presents the services offered to the user in which he can choose between the two options what kind of delivery he wants to make.
            </p>
            <p>
              As in the other pages, the design is simplistic with a few things on the page to make it easy to navigate. 
              Paage is made in this way so that it can be used by anyone who wants to send a package, you do not need certain knowledge to send a package.
              As there are few things to read, the user does not get bored reading these things.
            </p>
            <img src="images/ServicesPage.jpg" alt="image" class="center" />
            <p>
              The two delivery options are brief and do not make the user bored when reading them. Information is scarce and useful.
              In the page specific to the standard option we have details about the dimensions, the time in which the package can arrive, the rates and the completion dates for sending a package.
            </p>
            <img src="images/StandardDevpg1.jpg" alt="image" class="center" />
            <img src="images/StandardDevpg2.jpg" alt="image" class="center" />
            <img src="images/StandardDevpg3.jpg" alt="image" class="center" />
            <p>
              In the page specific to the "red code" option it is the same as the standard page, only the characteristics differ, because in the "red code" variants we want the packages to be sent in a short time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this part of the documentation we will discuss the wireframes related to this page
            </p>
            <img src="images/ServicePageWireframe.jpg" alt="image" class="center" />
            <img src="images/StandardDevWireframe.jpg" alt="image" class="center" />
            <p>
              Initial the wireframes looked something like this but when the design took place it became more comprehensive due to the information needed to send the packages
            </p>
          </section>

            <h2>QOC (Questions, Options, Criteria) </h2>

              To use this application you do not need high knowledge in a particular field or a high level of intelligence. This application is for anyone who wants to send a package, regardless of age or other things.
